# Formal review procedure: cross-language reconciliation and FFI proof maintenance

This document defines when formal evidence is required, which obligations a
change can affect, and what a pull request must record. It is additive: existing
model checkers, proof harnesses, property tests, fuzzers, and implementation
tests remain authoritative at their respective boundaries.

## Boundary

The procedure covers the existing CBMC, Kani, sanitizer, fuzz, property, and differential boundaries; this PR adds a machine-readable review procedure and does not replace those proof artifacts.

The repository already has code-level proof artifacts. This change adds no weaker replacement model; the obligation register points reviewers to the existing proof and differential boundaries.

The machine-readable source of truth is
`formal/review-procedure/obligations.json`; CI validates its schema and runs the
bounded sentinel where this PR supplies one.

## Obligations

1. **SYNC_ORDER (Safety).** The production timestamp comparator preserves numeric ordering, equality, and antisymmetry.
2. **SYNC_ABI (Safety).** Invalid C ABI strategy discriminants are rejected before parsing or dispatch.
3. **SYNC_FFI (Safety).** Rust/C discriminants and interior-NUL preconditions remain exact.
4. **SYNC_CONVERGE (Refinement).** Every supported binding produces byte-identical output for in-contract inputs.
5. **SYNC_IDEMPOTENT (Refinement).** Strategies documented as idempotent remain idempotent across bindings.

Safety and liveness are reviewed separately. A liveness claim must name its
fairness, delivery, resource, and eventual-synchrony assumptions instead of
presenting progress as unconditional.

## When to update formal evidence

Update this procedure, the obligation register, and the strongest applicable
model when a PR changes any registered trigger path in a way that can alter:

- state variables, guards, ordering, retries, expiry, cancellation, or recovery;
- deterministic normalization or serialization;
- identity, ownership, threshold, quorum, or provenance decisions;
- persistence/snapshot fields that carry safety-relevant history; or
- an implementation function named by an existing refinement test.

A refactor may state “no abstract transition change” only when the PR explains
why and names deterministic tests that demonstrate observational equivalence.

## Required change sequence

1. **State the semantic delta.** Write the old and new transition, affected
   state, guard, and postcondition before implementation review.
2. **Select obligations.** List every obligation ID affected. Do not use a broad
   “formal methods passed” statement in place of specific claims.
3. **Update the model/register.** Add the smallest transition or obligation that
   captures the behavior. Bounds may not be weakened merely to remove a
   counterexample.
4. **Add production refinement tests.** Reproduce the abstract transition using
   real production code, deterministic scheduling/time, and explicit failure
   injection where applicable.
5. **Run and record evidence.** Include commands, results, bounds, assumptions,
   and any intentionally unproved surface in the PR.

## Baseline commands

```sh
python3 formal/review-procedure/check.py
```

Repository-specific refinement evidence includes:

- `nix develop --command bash scripts/formal-check.sh all`
- `(cd bindings/rust && cargo kani)` after pinned Kani setup
- sanitizer, fuzz, property, and cross-language differential suites

## PR evidence block

## Reviewer stop conditions

Block approval when an obligation is affected but absent from the evidence
block; a timeout/transport loss is treated as proof of failure; a bound is
weakened without justification; model and implementation tests disagree; a
state migration drops safety-relevant history; or a deterministic claim is
supported only by a probabilistic run.
